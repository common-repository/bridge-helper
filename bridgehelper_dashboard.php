<p>Bridge symbols work in post excerpts, post body and comments.</p>
<p>Board diagrams work in post pody, but they're removed from post excerpts</p>

<h3>Bridge symbols insertion</h3>
<p>Just enter into your text !c (case insensitive) to insert &clubs; sign.
Accordingly use !d of &diams;, !h for &hearts; and !s for &spades;.</p>

<h3>Deal diagrams insertion</h3>

<p>Write in your text:
	<br />
	<pre>[deal nr='25' hand="A542.A32.A10865.K;.K8654.QJ10.Q7432;KJ109.QJ.K98753.J]</pre>

<p>Above will result in:
<ul>
	<li>board diagram with board number 25, vulnerabilities and dealer set accordingly</li>
	<li>hands above are separated by semicolon (;) and suits by full stops (.)</li>
	<li>North's hand: <br />
